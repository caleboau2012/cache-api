# cache-api
a REST API that exposes methods to interact with a cache. Built with Node.js (Express.js) and MongoDB (to store the cache data). All data returned by the cache is random dummy data :-).

### How to use
Please ensure you have mongo running and have the .env file as in this repo (feel free to edit with your own configurations)

Run the following commands.
npm install
npm start

### How to test
Please run npm test to run a series of tests I have outlined. Of course, these tests will have to change depending on any changes you make to the code...
